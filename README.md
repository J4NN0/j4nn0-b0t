Python Telegram BOT main features:
1. Store and retrive data from a database: you can save what you want and read it when you want. 
2. Set an alarm: when time is up the BOT will remind you what you asked for.
3. Exchange messages between strangers: store a message in unknown way. You can also send it for a certain person. In this way he/she will be able to read it but he/she will never know the writer of the message.  

The BOT is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

For its development I used [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) API and [sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html).

Check it out on telegram: [@J4NN0_Bot](http://telegram.me/J4NN0_Bot)

#### Easter egg

*There are also a lot of easter eggs (you can't find it in this code) that i wrote to have fun with my friends. Try to find them and enjoy!*

# How to host BOT on Heroku

1. Register on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
2. Download and install [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#set-up) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. Create a folder and put inside it
        
       bot.py
       Procfile
       runtime.txt
       requirements.txt
       
   You can also have a "app.json" schema useful to declare environment variables, add-ons, and other information required to run an app on Heroku. More info [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/app-json-schema)

4. Put inside "Procfile"

       worker: python script.py
   
5. Check your python version with

       python --version
        
   And put it in "runtime.txt". 
   For example, if the Python version is 3.6.6 just put inside the file:
   
       python-3.6.6

6. Specify explicit dependency versions inside "requirements.txt"
   
   For example i'm using [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) API.
   So my file "requirements.txt" will contain 
   
       python-telegram-bot==8.1.1
       
   To update this file, you can use the pip freeze command in your active virtual environment:
   
       pip freeze > requirements.txt
       
   More info [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-runtimes#selecting-a-runtime) 
   
7. Now in terminal 
   If you haven't already, log in to your Heroku account and follow the prompts to create a new SSH public key
   
       heroku login
   
   Create git repository   

       git init
           
    Or clone this repo
    
       git clone https://github.com/J4NN0/j4nn0-b0t.git
   
   Create heroku app
   
       heroku create
   
   Push your code (or deploy changes) into heroku app
   
       git add .
       git commit -m 'message'
       git push heroku master

8. Run your worker

       heroku ps:scale worker=1

9. Check logs with

       heroku logs --tail
        
10. Enjoy your bot
